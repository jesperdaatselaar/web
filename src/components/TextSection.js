          That will be me, Jesper! I'm a student from the Netherlands. I was
          born in 2003, and since a young age I always loved to capture every
          moment. But due to school, and cheap phones I never really captured
          the pictures I wanted to. In January 2021 I switched everything
          around, I bought my first camera: A Sony Alpha A6100. Since then I
          have been capturing a lot of moments in different Dutch and some
          European cities. Now, with the addition of a drone, a DJI Mini 2 to be
          specific, I will capture even more and more.
